# LLM Robotics Introduction to Psychology

This repository contains course materials for an introductory module on robotics and psychology. The focus is on how large language models (LLMs) and embodied agents can be used within psychological experiments. Materials are organized by week.

## Repository Structure

- `Week-1/Notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks with exercises and solutions.
- `Week-1/Papers/` – PDF articles for background reading.

## Using the Notebooks

The notebooks were created for use in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com), but they can also be run locally with Jupyter.

### Run in Google Colab

1. Open a browser and go to the Colab links provided in `Week-1/Notebooks/Exercises/Collab_links_for_ease.txt` and `Week-1/Notebooks/Solutions/Collab_links_for_ease.txt`.
2. Colab runs in the cloud so no local installation is required.

### Run Locally with Jupyter

1. Install Python 3.8 or newer.
2. Install Jupyter via `pip install jupyter`.
3. Launch Jupyter in the repository root:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Navigate to the `Week-1/Notebooks` folder and open any notebook.
